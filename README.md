Installing the plugin
============================

First, make sure you have the latest version of Sketch 3 installed and double click the Random Opacity.sketchplugin file. This will install the plugin automatically.


Using the plugin
============================

Next, select the objects that you want to randomly assign an opacity level to. Once selected, go to the Plugins dropdown in the menubar and choose Random Opacity.

Then, a modal dialog box will appear showing a range of odd numbers from 5 to 39. These are the default opacities that the plugin will use. You can leave them as is or change them to whatever values you’d like.

All that’s left to do is hit “OK” and the plugin will randomize the opacities for every object you selected. Pretty cool, huh?

Couple of notes: 1) don’t forget that seamless patterns need to have the same opacity levels on all four sides when the edges are overlapping, 2) the default opacity values are just what I've found works best through trial and error, feel free to tweak them yourself, and 3) once you get over 1000 selected objects or so the plugin might start beachballing.
